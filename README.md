## 🚀 Featured Project: Week 5 – OOP & Polymorphism
**Description:**  
A Python program demonstrating OOP principles by creating a base class and multiple subclasses that override methods to exhibit polymorphic behavior.  

**Topics Covered:**  
- Class creation and instantiation  
- Inheritance and method overriding  
- Polymorphism in action  
- Code reusability and maintainability
